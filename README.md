# Chatbot-Project


Chatbots are nothing but an intelligent piece of software that can interact and communicate with people just like humans.
Interesting, isn’t it? So now let's see how they actually work.
Imagine a user asking a question to a chatbot: 
“Hey, what’s on the news today?”The chatbot will break down the user sentence into two things: intent and an entity. The intent for this sentence could be get_news as it refers to an action the user wants to perform. The entity tells specific details about the intent, so "today" will be the entity.
So this way, a machine learning model is used to recognize the intents and entities of the chat.
